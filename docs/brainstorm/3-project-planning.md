# Project planning
- Breakdown the product into short-term key objects objectives with feedback loops, and well-defined derivables and milestones

# Cross-functional research and scope
- Research-desk, state-of-the-art papers, books, blogs, open source, packages, frameworks and platforms
- Decide and define approaches to test, what are the candidate solutions? Turn them into demos
- Define success criteria
- How rigorous should the MLOps maturity level be?
- How much time and resources should be allocated to the project?

# Experimentation (go/no-go project)
- Proof-of-concept (poc) bake-off
- Complexity and cost evaluation
- Business unit feedback
- Select project approach and define engineering objectives

# Development (project commit)
- Build phases mvp approach
- Test validation of simplest approach
- Business unit/sme feedback
- Production hardening (tests, mlps toolin)

# Deployment (project commit)
- Final subjective quality assessment test
- A/b test planning
- Business unit and sme go/no-go
- Model measurement, tracking, and drift monitoring

# Evaluation (project commit)
- Retraining (drift mitigation)
- Attribution (proving value)
- Business unit feedback on performance
- Cost, SLA, SLO, SLI, and continuous monitoring & retraining
